# Guntrader API Sync

A Bun application that syncs your advert data from the Guntrader API, stores it in a Postgresql database, and manages images by uploading them to to any S3 compatible storage. The application uses a cron job to update the database periodically and ensures that obsolete data is removed, including deleting related images from storage.

## Features

- Fetches gun data from the Guntrader API.
- Upserts gun records into a database using Prisma.
- Uploads gun images to DigitalOcean Spaces.
- Deletes old/obsolete guns and corresponding images from both the database and DigitalOcean.
- Runs periodically using `node-cron`.
